Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin's 50 Projects in 50 Days to better understand JavaScript.

Today we created a keyCode project that when you click down on the keyboard it shows what key you pressed, it's event.keyCode and the eventCode. Essentially taking Node elements and showcasing them. Got to use window.addEventListener so no matter where you clicked on the page with the keyboard it would show your key which is pretty cool. Also added a time delay lightly just so it's not as abbrasive. Fun project!
